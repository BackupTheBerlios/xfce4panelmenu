	format as root menu from Xfdesktop. By now including
	menus from external file and system menu are not supported.
	In Properities dialog it is possible to set up number of items
	to show in "most often used apps" menu.

second labeled as "Extensions" gives access to files browser and device
	mounter (see below) and is placed at bottom of the second column

third labeled as "User shortcuts" contains shortcuts for applications
	that you want start fast without looking for it in menu.
	This part is placed in columns from 2 to 6. You can edit it
	from Properities dialog or by editing
	"$HOME/.config/xfce4/menustart/userapps.xml" directly. Configuration
	file has the same format:
	
	1 Column--+

	...
	5 Column--+
		  +-- app
		  +-- app
		  +-- app
		  +-- app

	all entries other then "menu" on the first level are ignored and
	all entries other then "app" on the second level are ignored
	(if you were using earlier versions of this panel you will have to
	redefine this menu, otherwise you will see blank columns in menu)

Number of columns can be set in Properites dialog as number in 2..6,
3, 4, 5, 6 columns are used for "User shortcuts".
If the column is to small to show all entries in "recent apps"
or in "User shortcuts" you can scroll it with mouse wheel.
